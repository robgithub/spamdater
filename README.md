# spamdater
Python interogates Mail dir Spam to get dates
Python 2

reads a Mail Dir glob and extracts the email addresses to my domain and the date the email was sent.

collate then takes a sorted list and gets the first date each email used, for spam.

All just for my reference;
does easy to understand command line arg parsing
uses sets for uniqueness
regex search and findall
file reading line by line 
file writing line by line
write to stdout
